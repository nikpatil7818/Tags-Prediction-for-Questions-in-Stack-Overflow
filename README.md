# Tags-Prediction-for-Questions-in-Stack-Overflow
### Problem Description
 This project aims to use data and modeling to explore and predict tags for questions on Stack Exchange by using Natural Language Processing
 (NLP) with Keras Word2Vec and Paragraph2Vec technique.
 
 #### 1. Data Extraction:
 The initial step of the project focuses on extracting relevant data from the Stack Exchange API, which includes question
 texts, associated tags, and various metadata.
 #### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
 After data extraction, a thorough EDA will be conducted to gain insights into the dataset. This analysis
 will encompass data distribution, question-answer analysis length, word frequency, and other exploratory aspects.
 #### 3. Machine Learning Model Development:
 The core of the project involves developing a machine learning model that can predict the most
 appropriate tag for a given question based on the historical data. The model may utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques,
 feature engineering, and classification algorithms to achieve this task.
 
 The project aims to improve the efficiency of question tagging on Stack Exchange by automating the process with a reliable machine learning
 model. This will enhance the user experience, reduce manual effort, and promote a better organization of the platformâ€™s content.
